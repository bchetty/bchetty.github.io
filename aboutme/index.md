<p style="margin-top: 10px;">
My name is <b>Babji Prashanth, Chetty</b> (aka Prashanth / Bob). I have a Bachelors degree in 'Computer Science & Engineering' and 
have been programming / coding / developing business software applications (for work) and fun stuff (pet projects and other stuff 
for learning, etc) for more than 10 years. 
<br/><br/>

I  have always been fascinated with science & technology and am curious about many things.
I am also fascinated by different cultures and like to travel, experience it and understand the world in a better way. 
I want to use this website to capture/archive some of my work and to share that with others.
<br/><br/>
When I am not working, I am either reading up different stuff related to technology, world history, etc or playing board-games/badminton 
or binge-watching TV shows on Netflix and other streaming services.
I have played professional 'Cricket' for a club and represented my school and university teams. 
Lately, I haven't played any Cricket, but enjoying playing 'Badminton' regularly.
